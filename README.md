# System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a system for making driving lesson reservations and taking online driving lessons. The client saw an opportunity in the market to provide driving lessons and to help people pass their driving tests. They wanted a website that would help them achieve that goal. 
What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did a good job designing the activity and sequence diagrams for the system. I think they did a good job of describing the use cases. I believe my business requirements document was written well too. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part to revise, I would revise how I described the security of the system. I proposed that the system would be hosted on a cloud service such as Microsoft's Azure, but I don't know enough about their service to give definitive answers on how their service works. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to make sure that the user is pleased with your design, or else it is pointless. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
